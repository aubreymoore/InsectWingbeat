# InsectWingbeat
This repo documents my initial attempts to record insect wingbeat waveforms using an optical sensor and a Raspberry Pi.

In the late 80s and early 90s I did a bit of work on automated monitoring and identification of flying insects using waveforms collected by very simple none-imaging optical sensors. Hardware and software has certainly changed a lot since then. My contribution to the field was to suggest characterizing insect wingbeat waveforms using harmonic content in addition to the wingbeat frequency (=fundamental frequency).

Just for fun, I decided to hook one of my old sensors to a Raspberry Pi via a USB sound adaptor to see what kind of signals I could capture with minimum effort. Here's my setup:

## Hardware

The sensor is just a miniature solar cell connected to a small transformer which removes the DC component of the waveform (Fig. 1). Output from the sensor was connected to a Raspberry Pi 3+ single board computer using a CableCreation USB sound adaptor (Fig.2).

## Software

### Recording 

For recording, I installed Audacity 2.2.2 on my Raspberry Pi 3+ running Raspbian 10 and was pleasantly surprised that it ran very well. I operated the Raspberry Pi remotely using VNC.

### Analysis

For analysis, I installed the [Ecoacoustics Audio Analysis Software](https://ap.qut.ecoacoustics.info/) software on my Ubuntu 20.04 laptop.

## Experiment

* In this experment, I recorded insects flying between the sun an the sensor.
* I taped the sensor to the end of a 6 foot wooden pole and placed it in the direct sun just outside the balcony of my apartment. The sensor was connected to the USB sound adaptor using a 10 foot cable with appropriate connectors.
* I used Audacity to record four one-minute mono WAV files at a sample rate of 44100 Hz. Recordings were made on August 2020 between 11:30am and 11:40am in Yona, Guam. Weather was mostly sunny with light winds.

## Results

A few insect signals can be heard during playback of the recordings. Some of these are clearly visible in spectrograms (Figures 3,4,5,6).
